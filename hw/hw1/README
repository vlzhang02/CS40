Acknowledgments:
---------------
     
    We'd like to thank Christopher for clarifying data structure and the spec.
    We'd also like to thank Lexi for clarifying void pointers and Hansons 
    interface for lists. We'd like to thank Tina for giving us advice on 
    list_map and Cecelia for guiding us through debugging a segmentation 
    fault with readaline. We'd also like to thank Matt for helping with 
    general debugging of our program. We'd like to extend a big thank you to 
    Bridget, Kresten, Trevor, and Matt who stayed with us for multiple hours 
    trying to debug various issues. 

Implementation
------------
    We couldn't correctly restore turing-corrupt and sail-corrupt. We believe 
    our implementation could not correctly handle null characters injected into
    the original lines. This would cause our program to identify multiple 
    possible sequences of non-digit characters. We believe this messed with the
    width of each line, causing the squiggly slant appearance of the "restored"
    image. Sail-corrupt.pgm was also wrong in its identification of the 
    "correct" pattern of non-digit characters and thus was not restored 
    properly. If we had more time, we would love to fix this bug!
    
    We believe our implementation correctly restores every other image.

Time Spent
------------
We spent a total of over 55 hours on this assignment.
